### P0-fingerprint

_What does this pool give a job? HTCondor version, vacate/retirement settings, /staging, internet, container, condor_chirp, GPUs, inherited signal masks._

- Final job state: terminated ((1) Normal termination (return value 0); Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Remote Usage; Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Local Usage; Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Remote Usage;)
- Executions seen by the probe: 1; 'executing' events in job.log: 1 (an exit-85 restart in the same sandbox does not log one); NumJobStarts=1, NumShadowStarts=1 (condor_history).
- job.out contains output from 1 of 1 executions (tells whether stdout is kept across restarts).

### P2a-save85-vacate

_KEY TEST. If SIGTERM arrives after a voluntary checkpoint (step A) and the handler saves step B and exits 85, which step does the restarted job see: A or B? (Only checkpoint_exit_code is set.)_

- Final job state: terminated ((1) Normal termination (return value 0); Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Remote Usage; Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Local Usage; Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Remote Usage;)
- Executions seen by the probe: 3; 'executing' events in job.log: 2 (an exit-85 restart in the same sandbox does not log one); NumJobStarts=2, NumShadowStarts=2 (condor_history).
- Restart after exit 85: gap 1 s, same host, sandbox kept (marker file survived), restored step 60 (saved by: voluntary).
- Restart after exit 85: gap 31 s, same host, sandbox NEW, restored step 60 (saved by: voluntary).
- Trigger vacate fired at 11:26:56.4 (AP clock).
- Evicted execution received SIGTERM 0.0 s after the trigger (includes any retirement time and AP/EP clock offset); 1 signal(s) total.
- It exited with code 85, 0.6 s after the signal.
- Next execution restored step 60 (saved by: voluntary) -> the SIGTERM save (step 150) was LOST.
- job.out contains output from 3 of 3 executions (tells whether stdout is kept across restarts).

### P2b-evict-transfer-vacate

_Same as P2a, plus when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT. Is step B transferred on eviction? After a hard kill (-fast), where nothing can be transferred, does the job still restart from the spooled voluntary checkpoint A, or from scratch?_

- Final job state: terminated ((1) Normal termination (return value 0); Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Remote Usage; Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Local Usage; Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Remote Usage;)
- Executions seen by the probe: 3; 'executing' events in job.log: 2 (an exit-85 restart in the same sandbox does not log one); NumJobStarts=2, NumShadowStarts=2 (condor_history).
- Restart after exit 85: gap 1 s, same host, sandbox kept (marker file survived), restored step 60 (saved by: voluntary).
- Restart after exit 85: gap 201 s, same host, sandbox NEW, restored step 157 (saved by: signal).
- Trigger vacate fired at 11:30:57.7 (AP clock).
- Evicted execution received SIGTERM 0.3 s after the trigger (includes any retirement time and AP/EP clock offset); 1 signal(s) total.
- It exited with code 85, 0.9 s after the signal.
- Next execution restored step 157 (saved by: signal) -> the SIGTERM save (step 157) SURVIVED.
- job.out contains output from 3 of 3 executions (tells whether stdout is kept across restarts).

### P3a-grace-default-vacate

_How long between the soft-kill signal and SIGKILL, with default settings? Is there a retirement delay between the trigger and the signal? Does condor_hold behave like a vacate?_

- Final job state: terminated ((1) Normal termination (return value 0); Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Remote Usage; Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Local Usage; Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Remote Usage;)
- Executions seen by the probe: 3; 'executing' events in job.log: 2 (an exit-85 restart in the same sandbox does not log one); NumJobStarts=2, NumShadowStarts=2 (condor_history).
- Restart after exit 85: gap 1 s, same host, sandbox kept (marker file survived), restored step 5 (saved by: voluntary).
- Restart after killed (signal SIGTERM, no exit recorded): gap 86 s, DIFFERENT host, sandbox NEW, restored step 5 (saved by: voluntary).
- Trigger vacate fired at 11:37:13.0 (AP clock).
- Evicted execution received SIGTERM 0.2 s after the trigger (includes any retirement time and AP/EP clock offset); 1 signal(s) total.
- It never exited on its own: last sign of life 600.3 s after the signal = effective grace before SIGKILL.
- Next execution restored step 5 (saved by: voluntary).
- job.out contains output from 3 of 3 executions (tells whether stdout is kept across restarts).

### P4a-staging-vacate

_Is a SIGTERM save to /staging durable and found after the job is rescheduled (possibly on another host)? Do directory rename, fsync, and an atomic 'latest' pointer work on /staging? Is /staging visible inside the container?_

- Final job state: terminated ((1) Normal termination (return value 0); Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Remote Usage; Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Local Usage; Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Remote Usage;)
- Executions seen by the probe: 3; 'executing' events in job.log: 2 (an exit-85 restart in the same sandbox does not log one); NumJobStarts=2, NumShadowStarts=2 (condor_history).
- Restart after exit 85: gap 2 s, same host, sandbox kept (marker file survived), restored step 60 (saved by: voluntary).
- Restart after exit 85: gap 22 s, same host, sandbox NEW, restored step 131 (saved by: signal).
- Trigger vacate fired at 11:44:28.7 (AP clock).
- Evicted execution received SIGTERM 0.0 s after the trigger (includes any retirement time and AP/EP clock offset); 1 signal(s) total.
- It exited with code 85, 1.6 s after the signal.
- Next execution restored step 131 (saved by: signal) -> the SIGTERM save (step 131) SURVIVED.
- job.out contains output from 3 of 3 executions (tells whether stdout is kept across restarts).
